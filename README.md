*spawn your own node.js clouds, on your own hardware*

# What is haibu?

haibu is the open-source [node.js](http://nodejs.org) project for spawning and managing several node.js applications on a single server. It's an integral part of [Nodejitsu's](http://nodejitsu.com) production stack and is fully supported by a dedicated team of core node.js developers.

# How does it work?

haibu (which is Japanese for "hive") transforms node.js applications (using a [Carapace](https://github.com/nodejitsu/haibu-carapace)) into "drones". This approach allows haibu to directly interact with node.js applications and add all sorts of additional functionality. haibu also contains a plugin system, so you can easily add even more functionality without needing to dive too far into the codebase.

`haibu` builds on this concept of "drones" and exposes a robust and granular API for interacting with your node.js applications. At a low level, haibu's API is exposed as a RESTFul HTTP webservice. Any system that supports basic HTTP requests can communicate with a haibu server. If you are working in Node.js, haibu comes with a high-level Node.js API client.

## Where can I run haibu?

`haibu` doesn't discriminate. If your environment supports node.js, you can install `haibu` and start up your own node.js cloud. This makes `haibu` an ideal tool for both development purposes and production usage since you can seamlessly setup haibu on your local machine, on utility computing providers (such as Amazon EC2 or Rackspace), on dedicated servers, or even on a mobile phone!

## What are the parts of haibu?

`haibu` consists of 3 main applications, while only 2 of those are required to run your own cloud.

### haibu-balancer

`haibu` includes a load balancer that can manage domain filtering and drone load balancing for you.
The `haibu-balancer` application will spawn up a load-balancer for your haibu installation.
This is entirely optional and not all deployments will want to use it.

### haibu-server

`haibu-server` is `haibu`'s main server and drone management application.
This application is used to manage all of the drones that are active on a particular install as well as track installed apps.

### haibu

`haibu` is the main application used for interaction with a running haibu server.
This application will help administration of drones and applications.

# Installation

    [sudo] npm install haibu -g

# Documentation

haibu's documentation is still very much a work in progress. We'll be actively updating the documentation in the upcoming weeks to make it easier to get acclimated with `haibu`. Aside from the overview provided in this `README.md` file, `haibu` uses docco and literate style programming to provide comprehensive source code documentation. Check out `/docs/haibu.html` for more information.

# An overview of using haibu

## Starting up a haibu-server

```
[sudo] node bin/haibu-server
(...)
haibu started @ 127.0.0.1 on port 9002 as api-server
```

**Now that there is a haibu server running, we can begin to interact with it's API.**

##Starting an application using the haibu CLI

The haibu CLI allows for easy deployments into haibu with configuration files. A configuration file may be specified or the default '.haibuconf' file will be used. Haibu's CLI will recurse the directory path looking for the config file and prepopulate values for commands for you.

This is what a .haibuconf file may look like:

```javascript
{
  "address": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 9002
}
```

The address and port should correspond to our haibu server's API endpoint.
The API port is displayed in haibu-servers startup and defaults to port 9002.

Once we are in a directory with a package.json we want to use to deploy our script we can let the config file take care of communications to haibu for us:

```
haibu start
```

##Starting an application using the haibu Client
*(From: /examples/hello-spawn.js)*

Allows you to call haibu programmatically from inside your node.js scripts.

```javascript
var eyes = require('eyes'),
    haibu = require('haibu');

// Create a new client for communicating with the haibu server
var client = new haibu.drone.Client({
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 9002
});

// A basic package.json for a node.js application on haibu
var app = {
   "user": "marak",
   "name": "test",
   "domain": "devjitsu.com",
   "repository": {
     "type": "git",
     "url": "https://github.com/Marak/hellonode.git",
   },
   "scripts": {
     "start": "server.js"
   }
};

// Attempt to start up a new application
client.start(app, function (err, result) {
  if (err) {
    console.log('Error spawning app: ' + app.name);
    return eyes.inspect(err);
  }

  console.log('Successfully spawned app:');
  eyes.inspect(result);
});


client.start(app, function (err, result) {
  eyes.inspect(err);
  eyes.inspect(result);
});
```

## Using haibu-balancer

Once your node.js application has been started on `haibu` you're going to want to access it. `haibu-balancer` will load balance multiple instances of your application using [node-http-proxy][1] based on the `domain` property supplied in the package.json sent to each `start` request. Starting `haibu-balancer` is very simple:

```
sudo haibu-balancer
(...)
haibu started @ 127.0.0.1 on port 80 as balancer
```

Lets look at the sample data we sent to the `haibu-server` in the above example

```javascript
{
   "user": "marak",
   "name": "test",
   "domain": "devjitsu.com",
   "repository": {
     "type": "git",
     "url": "https://github.com/Marak/hellonode.git"
   },
   "scripts": {
     "start": "server.js"
   }
}
```

As you can see, the `domain` property is set to `devjitsu.com`. This means that incoming HTTP requests which have their `HOST` header set to `devjitsu.com` will be round-robin load-balanced across all instances of your application managed by `haibu`. If you're testing locally you can modify your `/etc/hosts` file for `devjitsu.com` and see your applications running in your local development environment.

## RESTful Webservice

If you need to integrate non-node.js systems with haibu, you can use haibu's RESTful JSON API. We recommend using haibu's native Node.js Client, but if you need to integrate with none-node.js systems this is not always a viable option.

**Starting an application through the webservice**

    POST http://127.0.0.1:9002/drones/test/start
    ...
    {
        "start": {
            "user": "marak",
            "name": "test",
            "domain": "devjitsu.com",
            "repository": {
                "type": "git",
                "url": "https://github.com/Marak/hellonode.git"
            },
            "scripts": {
                "start": "server.js"
            }
        }
    }

##Package.json settings

Haibu uses a package.json format extension in order to determine what to deploy.
Also, haibu is a pull based server; this means that it will pull files from outside of the server in order to deploy instead of using uploading directly into the process.

###Name

The name attribute is required and will represent the name of the application being deployed.

```json
{
  "name": "app-name"
}
```

###User

The user attribute is required and will represent the user who started up a drone.

```json
{
  "user": "myusername"
}
```

###Repositories

#### git

This type of repository will pull a git repository into haibu and deploy its contents.

```json
{
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "http://path/to/git/server"
  }
}
```

#### local

This type of repository will pull a directory relative to the `haibu-server` and deploy its contents.

```json
{
  "repository": {
    "type": "local",
    "directory": "/path/to/application"
  }
}
```

#### tar

This type of repository will pull a remote archive relative to the `haibu-server` and deploy its contents.

```json
{
  "repository": {
    "type": "tar",
    "url": "http://path/to/archive.tar"
  }
}
```

#### zip

This type of repository will pull a remote archive relative to the `haibu-server` and deploy its contents.

```json
{
  "repository": {
    "type": "zip",
    "url": "http://path/to/archive.zip"
  }
}
```

#### npm

This type of repository will install a npm package as application. The package will be available as directory under its name and the scripts will be installed in the `.bin` directory.
So scripts.start should have one of both as relative directory:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": ".bin/server.js"
}
```

or:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "name of npm package/server.js"
}
```

```json
{
  "repository": {
    "type": "npm",
    "package": "name of npm package"
  }
}
```

## Run Tests
All of the `haibu` tests are written in [vows][0], and cover all of the use cases described above.
<pre>
  sudo bin/test --spec
</pre>

*If you copy and paste the above link, the test suite will attempt to connect to Rackspace for some of the remote file tests. You don't need to run these tests or use Rackspace to get started. We'll be improving our test runner soon to help make this process a bit more intuitive.*

## FAQ

### `jitsu` is not working with `haibu`

`jitsu` is intended to work with the full production stack at Nodejitsu and should not be used with `haibu`.

### My drones are not being balanced in a logical order

Many browsers will submit multiple requests beyond a simple html page, favicons are a likely culprit.

### Do I have to use `haibu-balancer`?

No, `haibu-balancer` is a completely optional part of `haibu` and does not need to be run.
